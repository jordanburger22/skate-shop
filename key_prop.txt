How key Works

Adding: When a new skateboard is added to the skateboards array, React will create a new Skateboard component for it without disturbing the existing components.

Removing: When a skateboard is removed, React will remove the corresponding Skateboard component and leave the rest unchanged.

Updating: When a skateboard's data changes, React will only update the Skateboard component with the corresponding key.
